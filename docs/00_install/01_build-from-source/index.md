[[info | Building LeoPays is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to LeoPays, it is recommended that you install the [LeoPays Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

LeoPays can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build LeoPays using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | LeoPays Installation Recommended]]
| After building LeoPays successfully, it is highly recommended to install the LeoPays binaries from their default build directory. This copies the LeoPays binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/leopays/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the LeoPays release version.
