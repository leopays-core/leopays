If you have previously built LeoPays from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `uninstall.sh` script within the `leopays/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/leopays-core/leopays
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall LeoPaysÂ Dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt LeoPays binaries or building LeoPays for the first time.
