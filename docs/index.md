LeoPays is the next-generation blockchain platform for creating and deploying smart contracts and distributed applications. LeoPays comes with a number of programs. The primary ones included in LeoPays are the following:

* [leopays-node](./01_node/index.md) (node + leopays = leopays-node)  - core service daemon that runs a node for block production, API endpoints, or local development.
* [leopays-cli](./02_cli/index.md) (cli + leopays = leopays-cli) - command line interface to interact with the blockchain (via `leopays-node`) and manage wallets (via `leopays-wallet`).
* [leopays-wallet](./03_wallet/index.md) (wallet + leopays = leopays-wallet) - component that manages LeoPays keys in wallets and provides a secure enclave for digital signing.

The basic relationship between these components is illustrated in the diagram below.
